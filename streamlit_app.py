            This scatter plot allows us to visually explore relationships between different numeric features in the dataset. By selecting different x and y axes, we can see trends, clusters, or outliers that may not be obvious in summary statistics alone. 
                        
            In addition- coloring by categorical variables helps to see how different groups behave in relation to the selected features.

            Earlier we discussed how class imbalance can impact our analysis. In this scatter plot, if we color by a categorical variable that is imbalanced (`Ctry`, `S/C`, `Div`, `Conf`), we see that certain groups dominate the higher points of the plots.

            We wondered if top producing defencemen would all come from a certain class, but as we work through different features against eachother and color them by class- we come to see that at the top of the charts there's always a good bland of defencemen from different Divisions, Confrences, and Shooting Habits
            - However, in terms of `Ctry`, we do see that the top producing players exclusively only hail from the US, Canada, and Sweden. We were incorrect about assuming there would be more Russians at the top of the chart!

    - Explored and cleaned two raw datasets (Bio and Season Stats) for NHL defensemen
    - Investigated missing values and their impact on analysis
    - Examined class imbalance and its effect on feature distributions
    - Analyzed feature correlations, focusing on what drives point production
    - Used interactive scatter plots and pairplots to visualize relationships
    - Drew insights about which features matter most for predicting points
    
    **Final Thoughts:**
    - Assists and Even Strength Points are the most important features for predicting Points among defensemen
    - Top producing defensemen come from a mix of divisions and conferences, but the highest scorers are mostly from the US, Canada, and Sweden
    - My data is now ready for regression and prediction modeling for the final project!
